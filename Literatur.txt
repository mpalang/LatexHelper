   abstract = {M/TiO2 photocatalyst activity for H2 production depends on both the metal co-catalyst (M) and the reaction medium. To quantify such effects, we compared the performance of M/TiO2 photocatalysts (M=Pd, Pt, Au) for H2 production in different alcohol–water mixtures under UV excitation. Photocatalysts were prepared using Degussa P25 TiO2 at metal loadings of 0.5 and 1wt.% for Pd, 1wt.% for Pt and 1wt.% for Au. TEM, UV–Vis, XPS and EXAFS analyses confirmed the presence of supported metal nanoparticles of size ∼2, 1.3 and 5.4nm for Pd/TiO2, Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2, respectively. Photoluminescence data established that the metal co-catalysts effectively suppressed electron–hole pair recombination in TiO2 following photo-excitation. The activities of the M/TiO2 photocatalysts for H2 production were evaluated in a wide range of alcohol–water mixtures (alcohol concentration 10vol.%) under UV (365nm, 5mWcm−2). H2 production rates in the alcohol–water mixtures were dependent on (i) the metal co-catalyst; (ii) the co-catalyst loading; and (iii) the alcohol type. Co-catalyst activity followed the order Pd>Pt≈Au. The highest H2 production rates were achieved for the 1wt.% Pd/TiO2 photocatalyst in glycerol–water mixtures (47.5mmolg−1h−1) and 1,2-ethanediol–water mixtures (44.5mmolg−1h−1). H2 production rates decreased in the order glycerol>1,2-ethanediol>1,2-propanediol>methanol>ethanol>2-propanol>tert-butanol≫water. For each M/TiO2 photocatalyst, correlations were established between the rate of H2 production and specific alcohol properties, especially alcohol polarity and the exponential of the alcohol oxidation potential.},

   abstract = {Photocatalytic oxidation of propylene with molecular oxygen at room temperature was investigated over various silica-supported metal oxides with low loading. The photocatalytic active site is assumed to be the isolated tetrahedrally coordinated metal oxides in the ligand-to-metal charge-transferred state, such as (Mδ-−OLδ+)*. Photocatalytic epoxidation of propylene into propylene oxide was promoted over silica-supported V and Ti oxides at steady state. Over silica-supported Cr oxide, the propylene oxide formation rate was remarkably decreased with the time course in the reaction. The oxidation state and the coordination environment of the supported Ti, V, and Cr oxide species were determined by diffuse reflectance UV−vis spectroscopy (DRS) and electron spin resonance (ESR). During the photocatalytic oxidation, the oxidation state of the Ti4+ species was not varied. On the other hand, the V5+ species was partially reduced to V4+ and the Cr6+ species was successively reduced to Cr5+ and Cr3+. An isotopic tracer study of the C3H6−18O2 reaction suggests the difference of the active oxygen species between TiO2/SiO2 and V2O5/SiO2. The active oxygen species on TiO2/SiO2 is derived from molecular oxygen. On the other hand, the photogenerated products on V2O5/SiO2 incorporate the lattice oxygen of the surface metal oxide species. It is suggested that the kinds of terminal ligand (hydroxyl or oxo) of the tetrahedrally coordinated metal oxides on silica decide the active oxygen species in the photocatalytic oxidation. A photoinduced hole center on the monohydroxyl (SiO)3Ti−OH species activates molecular oxygen that reacts with propylene. In the case of the monooxo (SiO)3VO and dioxo (SiO)2CrO2 species, the photoactivated lattice oxygen (OL-)* directly reacts with propylene.},

   abstract = {The photocatalytic reactivities of various Ti-based photocatalysts have been investigated for various different types of reactions in order to achieve as highly efficient photocatalytic reactivities as possible. The reactivity of powdered TiO2 is dramatically enhanced by the addition of small amounts of Pt which initiates an effective charge separation of the photo-formed electrons and holes. The highly dispersed titanium oxide species prepared and encapsulated within the zeolite cavities as well as into the SiO 2 matrices exhibit high photocatalytic reactivities due to the high reactivities of their charge transfer excited states. With regard to the use of visible light, ion implantation of metal ions such as Cr or V into powdered TiO2 catalysts has been found to modify the electronic state of TiO 2 , resulting in the shift of the absorption band to longer wavelength regions, i.e., into the visible light region. The extent of the shift strongly depends on the type and concentration of the implanted metal. The present study focuses on the preparation of the photocatalysts, a detailed characterization of the active sites and their dynamics, the direct detection of the reaction intermediate species, as well as a clarification of the mechanisms behind the observed photocatalytic reactions at the molecular level. This work significantly contributes to advances in the design of photocatalysts which will be able to operate efficiently and effectively not only under UV irradiation but, most ideally, under visible light.},

The in situ photoluminescence, ESR, diffuse reflectance absorption, and XAFS (XANES and FT-EXAFS) investigations indicate that the titanium oxide species are highly dispersed within the zeolite cavities and exist in a tetrahedral coordination. The charge transfer excited state of the anchored titanium oxide species plays a significant role in the reduction of CO2 with H2O with a high selectivity for the formation of CH3OH, while the catalysts involving the aggregated octahedrally coordinated titanium oxide species show a high selectivity to produce CH4, being similar to reactions on the powdered TiO2 catalysts. The addition of Pt to the anchored titanium oxide catalysts promotes the charge separation which leads to an increase in the CH4 yields in place of CH3OH formation.},

The catalysts used were Degussa-P25 (TiO2-P25), Hombikat, Millennium, Kemira and s/g-TiO2, a catalyst prepared by a sol–gel method. The best photocatalytic behaviours have been obtained with those catalysts with higher surface area and the presence of only anatase phase (Hombikat and Millennium). A progressive deactivation of TiO2-P25 and s/g-TiO2 has been observed during the photocatalytic process. FTIR studies indicated that degradation mechanisms depended on the catalyst employed. Deactivation processes observed in TiO2-P25 have been correlated with the formation of carboxylates.},

   abstract = {Many metal oxide photocatalysts exhibit strong variations in their photocatalytic activities as a function of their crystallographic surface orientation. In this Perspective possible fundamental reasons for the surface dependent photocatalytic properties are discussed. The majority of the data imply that the differing surface activities for photo-oxidation and -reduction reactions are mainly a consequence of electron and hole diffusion towards different surfaces. This is either due to directional charge carrier diffusion as a result of bulk anisotropies or it is a consequence of differing band bending (or flat band potentials) at the interface of the photocatalyst with its environment. Although the fundamental reason for the surface electronic structure must lie in the surface structure, no correlation between surface chemical properties and photochemical properties has yet been unambiguously determined. The importance of surface charge separation and charge trapping at the surface leads to new concepts for engineering surface properties with potentially increased photocatalytic activity. Consequently, enhancement can be achieved by synthesizing photocatalyst powders that expose surfaces with 'naturally' higher photoactivity; or in a proposed approach by modifying surfaces selectively with special surface phases or monolayer heterostructures that enhance charge separation at the surface. In addition, special surface phases with a narrowed band gap may enable visible light activity of otherwise only UV active bulk materials.},

   abstract = {A new synthesis procedure that is based on the grafting of titanium alkoxide species chemically modified by acetylacetone (acac) on the surface of a P123/SBA-15 composite material is proposed to prepare Ti-SBA-15 catalysts and studied by a combination of elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid-state 13C (CP) NMR, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance UV−vis (DR-UV−vis), and N2 physisorption at −196 °C. In the absence of the acac chelates, the observed formation of anatase TiO2 onto the surface of the material demonstrates that the coordinating ligand acts as an inhibitor for the crystallization of anatase. Furthermore, FTIR and 29Si NMR results show that the chelated titanium alkoxide precursor interacts strongly with the silanol groups, which, in turn, greatly enhances the dispersion of the titanium species in the mesoporous silica matrix. Moreover, a decrease of the temperature applied for the postgrafting and an increase of both the acac/Ti ratio and pH are shown to favor the retention of titanium on the materials surface without affecting the titanium dispersion. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results, a maximal titanium content of 13.8% can be well-dispersed on the surface of the mesopores without formation of an excess on the external surface of the solids. However, the results of the DR-UV−vis analyses and the catalytic epoxidation of cyclohexene reveal that the maximal concentration of titanium species in tetrahedral coordination is obtained for materials with a Ti/Si ratio of 5.6%. Even if materials with higher titanium content do not show higher conversion of cyclohexene, they do exhibit remarkably low catalytic deactivation during the recycling tests. A higher hydrothermal stability is suggested as an explanation for the lower deactivation of Ti-SBA-15 at high titanium content.},

From the results it is concluded that titanate octahedra containing a short TiO distance show efficient luminescence at room temperature if these octahedra are isolated from each other. When the octahedra condense into a framework, the lowest absorption band shifts to much lower energy, and the Stokes shift and the quenching temperature of the emission decreases. This is shown for one-, two-, and three-dimensional frameworks of titanate polyhedra. The effect is ascribed to a broadening of the energy bands.},

The electron−hole recombination kinetics are consistent with a second-order process as demonstrated by a laser fluence dependence study. Interfacial hole transfer dynamics of the P-25 TiO2/SCN- complex are probed as a function of thiocyanate ion concentration. A dramatic increase in the population of trapped charge carriers is observed within the first few picoseconds, demonstrating that interfacial charge transfer of an electron from the SCN- to a hole on the photoexcited TiO2 effectively competes with electron−hole recombination on an ultrafast time scale. The experimental dependence of the charge carrier dynamics are shown to be consistent with a kinetic model of competing second-order processes. The implications of the results on the use of nanoscale TiO2 for photocatalysis are discussed.},

A global fit to the data predicts a bulk second-order recombination rate constant of (1.8 ± 0.7) × 10−10 cm3 s−1 for trapped electrons with holes. The signal at long times is attributed to electrons ejected from the nanocluster and/or deeply trapped electrons produced via third-order kinetics, consistent with an Auger process.},

   abstract = {The present paper reports and discusses results on the preparation, characterization and catalytic performances of silica-supported titania (TiO2/SiO2) catalysts. Samples were prepared by grafting titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti-OPri)4, dissolved in toluene, onto a silica surface in an N2 atmosphere, followed by steam hydrolysis and calcination. The samples were characterized by chemical analysis, BET surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), DR–UV–vis, FTIR and DRIFT spectroscopy analyses, TEM/EDX and NH3-TPD. The results indicated that the grafting preparation method gives rise to very strong Si–O–Ti bonds, that are responsible for high titanium dispersion. In particular, at low Ti loading, titanium species in tetrahedric coordination resulted prevalent on the catalyst surface until the maximum surface monolayer coating reached (∼2.2Ti atoms/nm2). The degree of polymerization of Ti species increases with further TiO2 load increases, giving rise to a large amount of octahedrical Ti-sites grafted on SiO2. The effects on the catalytic activity of TiO2/SiO2 catalysts with increasing quantities of TiO2 were also investigated. The catalytic results obtained in the epoxidation reaction of cyclooctene with cumene hydroperoxide showed the significant effect of titanium loading on the physicochemical and reactivity/selectivity properties of the silica-supported titania catalysts.},

Qualitatively similar results were obtained either with a ‘continuous reactant flow plus continuous u.v. illumination’ procedure allied to intermittent sampling, or with ‘pulsed reactant and analysis’ procedure. Both procedures yielded dependence upon alcohol pressure indicative of two parallel photoassisted pathways to (–H)* product, one being Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH*) and the other Eley–Rideal (ER*) in character. A decline in activity of the metal oxide surfaces as photoassisted conversion of alcohol increased was observed with both procedures and affected the LH* process for (–H)* more strongly. It is proposed that this LH* process involved alcohol chemisorption and hole localisation at coordinatively unsaturated O ions. The ER* process is envisaged to have involved encounter of alcohol (from the gas phase or from a reversibly adsorbed weakly bound state) with a much more numerous type of surface location capable of being photoactivated by hole capture. The proposed mechanisms account for observed dependences of the (–H)* process upon square root of the incident light intensity, upon alcohol pressure and upon oxygen pressure.},

   abstract = {Several transition metal (V, Cr, Fe)-substituted MCM-41-based specimens (Si/Me=80) were synthesized by the incorporation of the transition metal during synthesis. They were then loaded with titania via sol–gel method and the photoactivity in visible light was explored. The XRD analysis showed the patterns of neat MCM-41 similar to those of siliceous MCM-41, while the loading of titania was in its amorphous form. The BET surface areas, however, were lower than those commonly found in siliceous MCM-41. This is due to the partial pore breakage, as recorded by the pore size distribution analysis. The transition metal dispersion found in the majority of the specimens studied was quite high (in the vicinity of 50%) and decreased with the loading of TiO2. It was found that 25 wt% TiO2 loaded on calcined Cr-Ti-MCM-41 and Cr-MCM-41 exhibits activity in visible light which is comparable with that demonstrated by commercial Degussa P25, utilizing UV light for the degradation of formic acid. The same catalyst in fully reduced form as well as titania-loaded chromium-silicon oxide of adequate composition did not show any activity. TiO2/Fe-Ti-MCM-41 catalysts exhibited marginal activity for the degradation of formic acid. Similar vanadium-substituted catalysts (reduced and nonreduced) did not show any activity in visible light. These trends were also observed for the photodegradation of phenolic compounds in visible light, wherein the rates for 25% TiO2/Cr-Ti-MCM-41 were significant. This behavior is essential for the development of photocatalysts which operate using solar light. A comparative DR UV–vis study showed the substantial absorption of visible light by all the catalysts employed. Furthermore, the coexistence of Cr3+ and Cr6+ in fully oxidized chromium substituted materials was detected (Cr3+/Cr6+ ∼0.25). Extensive TPR studies revealed a number of transitions in the titania-loaded transition-metal-substituted catalysts. In particular, the temperature of the transition Cr3+→Cr2+ was found to considerably depend on the nature of chromium species in the MCM-41 matrix. This significantly contributes to the remarkable activity of TiO2/Cr-Ti-MCM-41 and TiO2/Cr-MCM-41, and this does not take place for both catalysts in their reduced form. Moreover, this transition is not present in the spent catalyst, which may be one of the possible reasons for deactivation. The surface composition of the most active catalyst was analyzed by XPS and showed considerable diffusion of chromium ions to the surface upon loading of titania. Two separate surface electronic levels were also found for TiO2/Cr-Ti-MCM-41, corresponding to Si-O-Cr and Ti-O-Cr regions. Such an arrangement creates an opportunity for a two-step excitation of titania by two photons in the visible range. The proposed route of the catalytic activity of the above material in visible light involves the reaction of dopant level electrons with surface Cr6+, which makes available valence band holes to perform oxidation reactions.},

In accordance with previous works, gas chromatographic (GC) online detection identified CH4 as the main product of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. It was found that the product formation is dependent on the light intensity, which verifies that CH4 is formed in a photon induced process on TiO2. A variation of the light intensity revealed that charge carrier recombination is more strongly enhanced compared to the charge transfer reaction to adsorbed species. On these grounds, the rate of CH4 formation increases only by the square root of the light intensity. Furthermore, product formation is predominantly a UV photon driven process. A further part of this study investigated the effect of H2O on the CH4 formation. The photocatalytic removal of carbon‐containing species and the CO2 reduction can already proceed with traces of adsorbed H2O, whereas a continuous flow of gaseous H2O results in an inhibition of product formation. Based on our study, we can identify highly promising routes for photocatalyst improvement.},

   abstract = {Abstract In this study, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction on TiO2 P25 was investigated for the first time under high‐purity continuous flow conditions with gas chromatographic (GC) online detection of CH4 as the main product. The thorough photocatalytic cleaning procedure in humid helium prior to all measurements was conducted under continuous flow too and we were able to monitor the decrease of carbonaceous contaminant concentration. On addition of CO2 to the feed under illumination, an increase in CH4 concentration was observed, which clearly follows the increase in CO2 concentration in the reactor. It was also demonstrated that CH4 formation ceases as soon as the lamp is switched off, providing clear evidence that the formation of CH4 from CO2 is a photoinduced process. It was shown that higher CO2 concentration accelerated CH4 formation under steady‐state conditions up to a certain optimum. Higher CO2 concentrations lead to a decrease in CH4 formation. This observation is tentatively assigned to a limited availability of photogenerated charge carriers at the TiO2 surface, or a lack of suitable catalytically active sites. Traces of O2 in the reactor completely hinder CH4 formation, implying that the lack of concomitant oxygen evolution observed in previous measurements on TiO2 is likely beneficial for the overall process. This study represents a first step towards performing true steady‐state kinetic studies of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.},

   abstract = {Vanadium oxide grafted on mesoporous silica SBA-15 has been synthesized using a controlled grafting process. Its structure has been thoroughly investigated using different characterization techniques, including N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The spectroscopic results revealed that under dehydrated conditions, the grafted vanadium domains are highly dispersed on the SBA-15 surface, composed predominately of isolated VO4 units with distorted tetrahedral coordination. The suggested (SiO)3VO sites on the silica surface include one short bond (∼1.54 Å) and three long bonds (1.74 Å). Methanol oxidation was used as a chemical probe reaction to examine the catalytic properties of these catalysts. At low vanadium loading, the vanadium species grafted on the surface show structural properties similar to those of vanadium-incorporated MCM-41 catalyst. However, the present mesoporous V-SBA-15 catalysts in the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde show remarkable catalytic performance compared with that of VOx/SBA-15 catalysts synthesized through a conventional wet impregnation method, which has been attributed to the homogeneous dispersion and uniformity of the catalytic vanadium species achieved on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameter and surface area. The acidic properties of V-SBA-15 was investigated by pyridine temperature-programmed desorption, which indicated the existence of both Lewis and Brönsted acid sites of the surface.},

These higher activities are only apparent when the respective catalysts are stabilized by sintering. The differences become even more pronounced when the catalysts are used in a tubular reactor. Optimum mixture concentrations are found to be 12 wt % zirconia and 16 wt % silica in titania. Both catalyst types exhibit activity maxima with respect to sintering temperature. It is hypothesized that the maxima arise from opposing effects of densification and phase transformation versus beneficial sintering. A comparison of our catalyst compositions with literature in this area suggests that the increase in activity due to the addition of silica or zirconia may be a result of higher surface acidity. However, isoelectric point measurements employing the unsintered and sintered catalysts show no conclusive increase in surface acidity. The effects of sintering temperature on the surface area, porosity, and crystal structure of the catalysts are also presented.},

In the case of rutile powders, the lifetime of the emission lengthened in the relation to the increase of particle size. Their lifetime was also dependent on the wavelength of excitation; i.e., it was longer at 355nm of excitation than at 266nm. Based on these results, the decay profiles of rutile particles were concluded to be determined by the migration of carriers from the bulk of the particles to the surface. In contrast, the decay profiles of the emission of small anatase particles were considered to be determined chiefly by the recombination process at the surface. The effects of Fe(III) ions and 2-propanol on the respective decay profiles of the emission from rutile and anatase powders are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The molecularly dispersed TiO2/SiO2 supported oxides were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of 2-propanol solutions of titanium isopropoxide. Experimental monolayer dispersion of surface titanium oxide species on SiO2 was reached at ∼4 Ti atoms/nm2 with a two-step impregnation procedure. The surface structures of the molecularly dispersed TiO2/SiO2 under various environments were extensively investigated by in-situ spectroscopic techniques (e.g., Raman, UV−vis−NIR DRS, and XANES) as well as XPS. The combined characterization techniques revealed the consumption of surface Si−OH groups and the formation of Ti−O−Si bridging bonds. In the dehydrated state, the surface Ti atoms in the 1% TiO2/SiO2 sample (0.24 Ti atoms/nm2) are predominantly found to be isolated TiO4 units, whereas at maximum surface coverage (∼4 Ti atoms/nm2), two-dimensional polymerized TiO5 units are dominant on the silica surface. The in-situ spectroscopic studies demonstrated that the coordination and ligands of the surface Ti cations change upon hydration/dehydration as well as during methanol oxidation. Methanol oxidation showed that the molecularly dispersed surface titanium oxide species exhibit completely different catalytic behavior (predominantly redox products) compared to bulk titanium oxide (predominantly dehydration products). Furthermore, the TOF of the surface titanium oxide species is strongly dependent on their local structures and varies by 1 order of magnitude (isolated TiO4 ≫ polymerized TiO5). These new results provide fundamental insights about molecular structure−reactivity/selectivity relationships of the molecularly dispersed TiO2/SiO2 supported oxides.},

   abstract = {The molecularly dispersed V2O5/SiO2 supported oxides were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of 2-propanol solutions of V-isopropoxide. The experimental maximum dispersion of surface vanadium oxide species on SiO2 was achieved at ∼12 wt % V2O5 (∼2.6 V atoms/nm2). The surface structures of the molecularly dispersed V2O5/SiO2 samples under various conditions were extensively investigated by in situ Raman, UV−vis−NIR DRS and XANES spectroscopies. The combined characterization techniques revealed that in the dehydrated state only isolated VO4 species are present on the silica surface up to monolayer coverage. Interestingly, the three-member siloxane rings on the silica surface appear to be the most favorable sites for anchoring the isolated, three-legged (SiO)3VO species. Hydration dramatically changes the molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species. The specific structure of the hydrated surface vanadium oxide species is dependent on the degree of hydration. The molecular structure of the fully hydrated vanadium oxide species closely resembles V2O5·nH2O gels, rather than V2O5 crystallites. The fully hydrated surface vanadium oxide species are proposed to be chain and/or two-dimensional polymers with highly distorted square-pyramidal VO5 connected by V−OH−V bridges, which are stabilized on the silica surface by the sixth neighbor of Si−OH hydroxyls via Si−OH···V hydrogen bonds. In analogy to the hydration process, alcoholysis occurs during methanol chemisorption, and similar molecular structures are proposed to interpret the interaction between methanol molecules and the surface vanadium oxide species on silica.},

The superior performance can be attributed to not only the light-induced preferential flow of photogenerated electrons and holes onto different facets of the square-like WO3, thus leading to the reduction and oxidation reactions taking place on the corresponding edged and major top facets, but also the selective deposition of suitable oxidation and reduction cocatalysts onto the needed facets of square-like WO3 to reduce the charge recombination and catalyze the redox reactions. These findings will be promising and intriguing for designing high efficiency WO3 system for visible light water splitting.},

In this Review, current approaches for the heterogeneous photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on TiO2 and other metal oxide, oxynitride, sulfide, and phosphide semiconductors are presented. Research in this field is focused primarily on the development of novel nanostructured photocatalytic materials and on the investigation of the mechanism of the process, from light absorption through charge separation and transport to CO2 reduction pathways. The measures used to quantify the efficiency of the process are also discussed in detail.},

   abstract = {Abstract 2-Propanol and oxygen were converted over titania and gold nanoparticles supported on titania to investigate the reactivity of the support, the influence of the metal and the role of metal–support interactions. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption and transmission electron microscopy. In addition to deriving the degrees of conversion and the yields as a function of temperature, temperature-programmed desorption and diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy were applied in fixed-bed reactors under continuous flow conditions. Over pure TiO2 above 500 K the acid–base catalyzed dehydration yielding propene and water, the dehydrogenation to acetone and H2, and the oxidative dehydrogenation to acetone and water were found to occur. The additional presence of Au nanoparticles induced the selective oxidation to acetone and H2O at temperatures below 400 K, whereas the selective oxidation to acetone at higher temperatures above 500 K was also observed on pure TiO2. Also the dehydration of 2-propanol to propene and H2O and, to a minor extent, the total oxidation to CO2 and H2O were catalyzed by Au/TiO2. Therefore, the Au/TiO2 catalyst shows bifunctional properties in oxygen activation needed for the selective oxidation of 2-propanol. 2-propoxide species were detected by IR spectroscopy, which are identified as intermediate species in 2-propanol conversion, whereas strongly bound acetates and carbonates acted as catalyst poison for the selective low-temperature oxidation route, but not for the high-temperature route. Selective low-temperature oxidation is assumed to occur at the perimeter of the Au nanoparticles, which also enhance the high-temperature oxidation route on TiO2 pointing to a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism based on an enhanced reducibility of TiO2.},

   abstract = {In this work the photoluminescence (PL) of CoxFe3−xO4 spinel oxide nanoparticles under pulsed UV laser irradiation (λexc = 270 nm) is investigated for varying Co/Fe ratios (x = 0.4⋯2.5). A broad emission in the green spectral range is observed, exhibiting two maxima at around 506 nm, which is dominant for Fe-rich nanoparticles (x = 0.4, 0.9), and at around 530 nm, that is more pronounced for Co-rich nanoparticles (x > 1.6). As examinations in different atmospheres show that the observed emission reacts sensitively to the presence of water, it is proposed that the emission is mainly caused by OH groups with terminal or bridging metal–O bonds on the CoxFe3−xO4 surface. Raman spectroscopy supports that the emission maximum at 506 nm corresponds to terminal OH groups bound to metal cations on tetrahedral sites (i.e., Fe3+), while the maximum around 530 nm corresponds to terminal OH groups bound to metal cations on octahedral sites (i.e., Co3+). Photoinduced dehydroxylation shows that OH groups can be removed on Fe-rich nanoparticles more easily, leading to a conversion process and the formation of new OH groups with different bonds to the surface. As such behavior is not observed for CoxFe3−xO4 with x > 1.6, we conclude that the OH groups are more stable against dehydroxylation on Co-rich nanoparticles. The higher OH stability is expected to lead to a higher catalytic activity of Co-rich cobalt ferrites in the electrochemical generation of oxygen.},

Release profiles of the drug to the aqueous media showed that in all cases solubility of the drug was significantly increased (more than 10-fold improvement). Such enhancement in the solubility of ciprofloxacin can be explained on the basis of favorable particle chemical formula in the composite, with protonated carboxylic group, in an addition to the drug amorphization, as suggested by the XRD profiles. SBA-15 with the largest pores and intermediate ciprofloxacin content (13%) showed the slowest release rate, suggesting that type of interaction between adsorbed drug and the carrier is the most important factor governing the release rate. Toxicity and viability tests were carried out and showed that unmodified SBA-15 at moderate concentrations can be used as a safe carrier, not influencing the proliferation and metabolic activity of the cells.},

Modern approaches to the characterization of solid catalysts from the adsorption-desorption data based mainly on n-layer adsorption and non-linear three parameter BET isotherm regarding the volume of micropores as one of the parameters are demonstrated. Instrumentation techniques like infrared spectroscopy or NMR techniques for the analysis of the strength of component chemisorption are mentioned. As for the kinetics, a vague capability of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson models to describe a reaction system in more complicated cases, e.g. bimolecular surface reactions, is discussed. In this context, the simplest model with a minimum number of parameters is advised. To estimate the most realistic values, intrinsic reaction kinetic and mass transport phenomena are taken into account. Usefulness of quantum mechanistic models for better understanding of the catalytic phenomena and more efficient design of catalysts are outlined.},

Now, without simplifying assumptions the following exact system is derived: -di=-12(S+K)uidx+12Svjdx,dj=-12(S+K)vjdx+12Suidx,u≡∫0π/2(∂i/i∂φ)(dφ/cosφ),         v≡∫0π/2(∂j/j∂φ)(dφ/cosφ), φ≡angle from normal of the light). Both systems become identical when u=v=2, that is, for instance, when the material is perfectly dull and when the light, is perfectly diffused or if it is parallel and hits the specimen under an angle of 60° from normal. Consequently, the different formulas Kubelka-Munk got by integration of their differential equations are exact when these conditions are fulfilled. The Gurevic and Judd formulas, although derived in another way by their authors, may be got from the Kubelka-Munk differential equations too. Consequently, they are exact under the same conditions. The integrated equations may be adapted for practical use by introducing hyperbolic functions and the secondary constants a=12(1/R∞+R∞) and b=12(1/R∞-R∞), (R∞≡reflectivity).

Mesoporous materials have been of great interest as catalysts because of their unique textural and structural properties. Mesoporous TiO2, SiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2/SiO2 nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by sol–gel method using titanium (IV) isopropoxide, tetra-ethylorthosilicate as starting materials. The synthesized samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV–Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauett–Emmett–Teller and field-dependent photoconductivity. The UV–Vis spectrum of as-synthesized samples shows similar absorption in the visible range. The crystallite size of the as-synthesized samples was calculated by Scherrer’s formula. The BET surface area for TiO2/SiO2 nanocomposite is found to be 303 m2/g and pore size distribution has average pore diameter about 10 nm. It also confirms the absence of macropores and the presence of micro and mesopores. The field-dependent photoconductivity of TiO2/SiO2 nanocomposite shows nearly 300 folds more than that of TiO2 nanoparticle for a field of 800 V/cm.},

   abstract = {The shortage of fossil fuels and the disastrous pollution of the environment have led to an increasing interest in artificial photosynthesis. The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into solar fuel is believed to be one of the best methods to overcome both the energy crisis and environmental problems. It is of significant importance to efficiently manage the surface reactions and the photo-generated charge carriers to maximize the activity and selectivity of semiconductor photocatalysts for photoconversion of CO2 and H2O to solar fuel. To date, a variety of strategies have been developed to boost their photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 photoreduction. Based on the analysis of limited factors in improving the photocatalytic efficiency and selectivity, this review attempts to summarize these strategies and their corresponding design principles, including increased visible-light excitation, promoted charge transfer and separation, enhanced adsorption and activation of CO2, accelerated CO2 reduction kinetics and suppressed undesirable reaction. Furthermore, we not only provide a summary of the recent progress in the rational design and fabrication of highly active and selective photocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO2, but also offer some fundamental insights into designing highly efficient photocatalysts for water splitting or pollutant degradation.},

   abstract = {CO2 photoreduction with water vapor has been studied on three TiO2 nanocrystal polymorphs (anatase, rutile, and brookite) that were engineered with defect-free and oxygen-deficient surfaces, respectively. It was demonstrated that helium pretreatment of the as-prepared TiO2 at a moderate temperature resulted in the creation of surface oxygen vacancies (VO) and Ti3+ sites on anatase and brookite but not on rutile. The production of CO and CH4 from CO2 photoreduction was remarkably enhanced on defective anatase and brookite TiO2 (up to 10-fold enhancement) as compared to the defect-free surfaces. Defective brookite was photocatalytically more active than anatase and rutile, probably because of a lower formation energy of VO on brookite. The results from in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analyses suggested that (1) defect-free TiO2 was not active for CO2 photoreduction since no CO2– is generated, and (2) CO2 photoreduction to CO possibly underwent different reaction pathways on oxygen-deficient anatase and brookite via different intermediates (e.g., CO2– on anatase; CO2– and HCOOH on brookite). The combined DRIFTS and photoactivity studies reported in this paper have provided new insights to the role of surface defects in CO2 photoreduction on TiO2 nanocrystals, and revealed significant information on the much less studied but promising brookite phase.},

At higher Mo content (15.4 and 20.1 wt%), MoOx nanoparticles together with small amount of MoO3 crystallites were found. The growth of MoOx species in mesoporous channels to MoOx nanoparticles causes the collapse of the silica wall of SBA-15. The rate of ethane conversion per Mo atom over the catalyst with Mo content of 9.5–20.1 wt% was significantly higher than that over the catalyst with lower Mo content, suggesting that polymeric MoOx clusters and MoOx nanoparticles are more active toward ethane activation. The catalysts with highly dispersed MoOx species favor the selectivity of acetaldehyde, whereas those containing polymeric MoOx clusters or MoOx nanoparticles show higher formaldehyde formation rates. Formaldehyde is likely produced through the consecutive oxidation of ethylene.},

The charge-carrier recombination lifetime and the interfacial electron-transfer rate constant that are derived from the TRMC measurements correlate with the CW photo-oxidation quantum efficiency obtained for aqueous chloroform in the presence of TiO. The quantum efficiencies are 0. 4 % for Q-TiO, 1. 6 % for Degussa P25, and 2. 0 % for Fe-doped Q-TiO. The lower quantum efficiencies for Q-TiO are consistent with the relative interfacial electron-transfer rates observed by TRMC for Q-TiO and Degussa P25. The increased quantum efficiencies of Fe-doped Q-TiO and the observed TRMC decays are consistent with a mechanism involving fast trapping of valence-band holes as Fe and inhibition of charge-order recombination.},

The coupling of the reaction to a sacrificial oxidation reaction hinders or entirely prohibits the formation of CH4 as a reduction product. This agrees with earlier work in which the detrimental effect of oxygen-evolving cocatalysts was demonstrated. Photocatalytic alcohol oxidation or even overall water splitting proceeds in these reaction systems, but carbon-containing products from CO2 reduction are no longer observed. H2 addition is also detrimental, either because it scavenges holes or because it is not an efficient proton donor on TiO2. The results are discussed in light of previously suggested reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The formation of CH4 from CO2 is likely not a linear sequence of reduction steps but includes oxidative elementary steps. Furthermore, new hypotheses on the origin of the required protons are suggested.},

   abstract = {Dispersed vanadia and titania are of great interest due to their (photo)catalytic properties. The structure of isolated (highly dispersed) vanadia and titania has been studied using a combination of deep UV Raman, UV–vis, and IR spectroscopy. Highly dispersed vanadia and titania were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of the corresponding isopropoxide precursors onto silica SBA-15. Using resonance Raman spectroscopy, a wide range of vanadium (0.00001–0.7 V/nm2) and titanium (0.001–0.7 Ti/nm2) loadings can be analyzed. At very low loadings (<0.05 M/nm2) the structure of both highly dispersed vanadia and titania is characterized by tetrahedral coordination of the central atom and anchoring to the support by one or more M–O–S linkages. At higher loadings, titania partly forms oligomeric surface structures according to UV–vis results. In the case of highly dispersed vanadia samples (<0.1 V/nm2), Raman spectroscopy reveals distinct differences in the vanadia surface structures under ambient and dehydrated conditions. Corresponding UV–vis spectra indicate the formation of isolated and oligomeric vanadia surface structures. A smaller dependence of the titania surface structure on the environmental conditions (ambient/dehydrated) was observed. For the 0.7 M/nm2 samples, the presence of hydroxylated vanadia and titania structures in the dehydrated state was verified by IR spectroscopy. The assignment of the vibrational bands was facilitated by the results of a normal-mode analysis using models based on polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). Our study clearly demonstrates the potential of resonance Raman spectroscopy using 217.5 nm deep UV excitation to study the surface structure of transition metal oxide species even in isolated conditions.},

The photocatalytic activity and the solar energy properties of the MTM are characterized by UV–vis spectrophotometer, spectrofluorometer and photoinduced I–V measurement. The photocatalytic test indicates that the MTM has higher efficiency than the commercial P25 with a good recyclability due to its large-scale membrane style and the preliminary result on the solar cell application shows a solar energy conversion efficiency of 3.35% for the dye-sensitized solar cell utilizing the MTM.},

   abstract = {The complete mineralization of trichloroethylene (Cl2CCClH), in dilute aqueous solutions, to HCl and CO2 is demonstrated with heterogeneous photoassisted catalysis using illuminated titanium dioxide (TiO2). An intermediate, dichloroacetaldehyde, is identified, and a photoassisted reaction sequence is proposed. A simple Langmuirian rate equation satisfactorily represents both the disappearance of initial reactant, trichloroethylene, and intermediate, dichloroacetaldehyde, as well as the inhibitory influence of product HCl. The present paper and two related reports (A. L. Pruden and D. F. Ollis, Environ. Sci. Technol., in press; C.-Y. Hsiao, C.-L. Lee, and D. F. Ollis, J. Catal. 82, 418 (1983)) establishing mineralization of chloromethanes, indicate some potential for removal of the two most common chlorocarbon contaminants from water via heterogeneous photocatalysis.},

   abstract = {A series of supported 1−60% TiO2/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized and subsequently used to anchor surface VOx redox and surface WOx acid sites. The supported TiOx, VOx, and WOx phases were physically characterized with TEM, in situ Raman and UV−vis spectroscopy, and chemically probed with in situ CH3OH-IR, CH3OH-TPSR and steady-state CH3OH dehydration. The CH3OH chemical probe studies revealed that the surface VOx sites are redox in nature and the surface WOx sites contain acidic character. The specific catalytic activity of surface redox (VO4) and acidic (WO5) sites coordinated to the titania nanoligands are extremely sensitive to the degree of electron delocalization of the titania nanoligands. With decreasing titania domain size, <10 nm, acidic activity increases and redox activity decreases due to their inverse electronic requirements. This is the first systematic study to demonstrate the ability of oxide nanoligands to tune the electronic structure and reactivity of surface metal oxide catalytic active sites.},

In particular, water-splitting by photoelectrolysis was verified to be a unique route for hydrogen production, since there are the abundance of the water and light around the world. Semiconductor metal oxides such as TiO2, Ta3N5, and Ag3VO4 are often treated as the photocatalysts for light-induced photo-oxidation of water. In this work, various kinds of vanadium oxides, V6O13, VO2(B), VO2(M), and V2O5 were examined their activity of hydrogen-production. From the results of cyclic voltammogram and the UV–vis spectra, the potential band structure for each sample was constructed. As a consequence, the relative NHE potential was achieved, and all the vanadium oxides prepared in this study were qualified as the visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for hydrogen production. The accumulative amount of hydrogen-production within 4h illumination increased in the order of V6O13>VO2(M)>V2O5>VO2(B).},

We will ensure that renewable energy sources are adequately considered in our national plans and encourage others to do so as well. We encourage continuing research and investment in renewable energy technology, throughout the world”. Communique from the G8 Leaders’ Summit, Genoa, July 2001. The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC confirmed that the Earth’s climate is changing as a result of human activities, particularly from energy use, and that further change is inevitable. Natural ecosystems are already adapting to change, some are under threat, and it is evident that human health and habitats will be affected world-wide. Such climate changes could also affect the present supplies of renewable energy sources and the performance and reliability of the conversion technologies. This paper concentrates on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the role that the global renewable energy industry might play in this regard. (The five other major greenhouse gases are given less emphasis here.) The paper compares the costs of renewable energy systems with fossil fuel-derived energy services and considers how placing a value on carbon emissions will help provide convergence. The move towards a de-carbonised world, driven partly by climate change science and partly by the business opportunities it offers, will need to occur sooner rather than later if an acceptable stabilisation level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is to be achieved. Government policy decisions made now will determine the sort of future world we wish our children to inherit. The renewable energy era has begun.},

   abstract = {The reduction and reoxidation of submonolayer coverages of TiO2 deposited onto MCM-48 were investigated. The deposited TiO2 was characterized by Raman and UV−visible spectroscopy. Raman spectra show that Ti atoms are bonded to the silica support by Ti−O−Si bonds and that crystalline TiO2 is not formed. The results of the Raman and UV−visible spectroscopy suggest that the dispersed TiO2 is present as two-dimensional oligomeric structures. Reduction in H2 at 923 K produces Ti3+ cations observable by EPR (g = 1.932), suggesting the formation of oxygen vacancies. The fraction of Ti that could be reduced increased with TiO2 surface concentration. This observation is attributed to the ease with which O atoms can be removed from the TiO2 overlayer as the size of the titania patches increases. The amount of oxygen removed during reduction was quantified by pulsed reoxidation. It was observed that the temperature required for complete reoxidation decreased with increasing surface coverage of the silica support by TiO2. This trend is explained with a proposed model of the reoxidation process, in which the rate limiting step is the migration of peroxide species through or between the deposited TiO2 patches. A linear correlation was established between the intensity of the EPR signal for Ti3+ and the amount of oxygen removed from TiO2/SiO2. This relationship was then used to determine the oxygen vacancy concentration present on the surface of TiO2/SiO2 after temperature-programmed oxidation of methanol.},

The results showed that MnOx/SBA-15 possessed good catalytic capacity for the ozonation of OA. The influences of tert-butanol and phosphate on OA removal and ozone equilibrium concentration in aqueous solution demonstrated that initiation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) was involved and surface reaction played the major role in O3/MnOx/SBA-15. The effects of manganese content and initial solution pH verified that surface hydroxyl groups affected by the pH of solution and the point of zero charge (pHPZC) of catalysts, were closely related to OA adsorption and OH initiation on the surface of MnOx/SBA-15. The pre-ozonated catalyst improved its catalytic activity a little due to the enhancement of electron transfer in the presence of higher multivalent MnOx (Mn(III)/Mn(IV)). It was concluded that the protonated surface hydroxyl groups were the main reaction sites and a possible catalytic ozonation mechanism of OA over MnOx/SBA-15 was proposed.},

Surface-trapped electrons and surface-trapped holes were generated within [similar]200 fs (time resolution). Surface-trapped electrons, which gave an absorption peak at around 800 nm, and bulk electrons, which absorbed in the IR wavelength region, decayed with a 500-ps time constant due to relaxation into deep bulk trapping sites. It is already known that, after this relaxation, electrons and holes survive for microseconds. We interpreted these long lifetimes in terms of the prompt spatial charge separation of electrons in the bulk and holes at the surface.},

   abstract = {Abstract The optical constants of amorphous Ge are determined for the photon energies from 0.08 to 1.6 eV. From 0.08 to 0.5 eV, the absorption is due to k-conserving transitions of holes between the valence bands as in p-type crystals; the spin-orbit splitting is found to be 0.20 and 0.21 eV in non-annealed, and annealed samples respectively. The effective masses of the holes in the three bands are 0.49 m (respectively 0.43 m); 0.04 m, and 0.08 m. An absorption band is observed below the main absorption edge (at 300 °K the maximum of this band is at 0.86 eV); the absorption in this band increases with increasing temperature. This band is considered to be due to excitons bound to neutral acceptors, and these are presumably the same ones that play a decisive role in the transport properties and which are considered to be associated with vacancies. The absorption edge has the form: ω2ϵ2∼(hω−Eg)2 (Eg = 0.88 eV at 300 °K). This suggests that the optical transitions conserve energy but not k vector, and that the densities of states near the band extrema have the same energy-dependence as in crystalline Ge. A simple theory describing this situation is proposed, and comparison of it with the experimental results leads to an estimate of the localization of the conduction-band wavefunctions.},

   abstract = {Time-resolved luminescence was measured on a colorless anatase single crystal under pulsed-laser excitation. The time evolution of luminescence is composed of fast and slow components with time constants of 10−6 and 10−5s, respectively. The fast component corresponds to a direct formation of STE. Some traps near the conduction band give a retardation effect on the slow component. The traps are occupied by conduction electrons at low temperatures and the trapped electron can be excited thermally at temperatures higher than 100K. They compete with non-radiative recombination process. A possible model for the relaxation process is proposed.},

   abstract = {Degussa P25 TiO2 doped with nitrogen via NH3 treatment at 400–600 °C was found to be capable of catalyzing the photo-oxidation of aqueous As(iii) to As(v) under visible light. Substitutional doping of N for O creates N–Ti–O surface linkages, as confirmed by XPS. Kinetic studies have been performed in batch systems with 40 μM As(iii) and 0.05 g L−1 TiO2. Photocatalytic oxidation of As(iii) in the presence of N-doped TiO2 annealed at 500 °C was complete within 4 hours of irradiation at λ > 435 nm. The presence of titanium oxynitride (or similar surface moieties) is linked with the good photooxidation catalytic activity toward As(iii). Zeta potentials of the N-doped TiO2 showed negative shifts at low pH values, which became more pronounced when measured after photocatalytic testing, suggesting at least partial retention of As(v). First principles DFT calculations were also carried out for a model anatase (101) surface, in both the pristine and N-doped condition. Dissociation of water is energetically favoured over the N-TiO2 surface. This surface activation mechanism provides the rationale for increased As(v) retention. Enhanced adsorptive properties in TiO2 would render it a more versatile remediation agent.},

   abstract = {Abstract The characteristics of pre-edge peaks in K-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of 3d transition metals were reviewed from viewpoints of the selection rule, coordination number, number of d-electrons, and symmetry of the coordination sphere. The contribution of the electric dipole and quadrupole transition to the peaks was discussed on the basis of the group theory, polarized spectra, and theoretical calculations. The pre-edge peak intensity for Td symmetry is larger than those for Oh symmetry for all 3d elements. The intense pre-edge peak for tetrahedral species of 3d transition metals is not due to 1s–3d transition, but transition to the p component in d–p hybridized orbital. The mixing of metal 4p orbitals with the 3d orbitals depends strongly on the coordination symmetry, and the possibility is predictable by group theory. The transition of 1s electron to d orbitals is electric quadrupole component in any of the symmetries. The d–p hybridization does not occur with regular octahedral symmetry, and the weak pre-edge peak consists of 1s–3d electric quadrupole transition. The pre-edge peak intensity for a compound with a tetrahedral center changes as a function of the number of 3d electrons regardless of the kind of element; it is maximized at d0 and gradually decreases to zero at d10. The features of pre-edge peaks in K-edge XANES spectra for 4d elements and the L1-edge for 5d elements are analogous with those for 3d elements, but the pre-edge peak is broadened due to the wide natural width of the core level.

   abstract = {The liquid-phase photocatalytic oxidative degradation of 1-octanol in oxygenated acetonitrile on highly dispersed titanium oxide catalysts anchored onto transparent Vycor glass was compared with that obtained on standard TiO2powder. The anchored photocatalysts were prepared through the facile reaction between surface OH groups of Vycor glass and TiCl4. UV irradiation of the anchored catalyst at room temperature led to the photocatalytic degradation of 1-octanol and the production of 1-octanal as the major product. The large surface area of the photocatalyst was one of the most important factors in achieving a high efficiency in the liquid-phase photocatalytic reaction. The specific photocatalytic activity per unit weight of titanium oxide of the highly dispersed anchored catalyst was much higher than that for the TiO2powder because of the high activity of the charge transfer complex (Ti3+–O−)*. Furthermore, the filtration of the anchored photocatalysts from the liquid reactants was much easier than that of the small particles of TiO2powder.},

Here we show that, under proton-free conditions and using iodide ions in acetonitrile as the hole scavenger, the intrinsic electron-trapping feature of titanium dioxide nanoparticles does not exhibit the characteristic UV-vis absorption and infrared absorption signatures. Further electron spin resonance studies identify the proton-free electron-trapping state as the lattice octahedral Ti6c3+ species, differing from the traditional proton-participating surface tetrahedral Ti4c3+ species. Synchronized radiation ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results also show that the internal electron-trapping state without protons has a larger Ti3d binding energy (1.8 eV) than the blue electron-trapping state (1.3 eV) that forms when protons participate and thus shows different electron transfer abilities.},

   abstract = {By comparing the transient absorption spectra of nanosized anatase TiO colloidal systems with and without SCN, the broad absorption band around 520 nm observed immediately after band-gap excitation for the system without SCN has been assigned to shallowly trapped holes. In the presence of SCN, the absorption from the trapped holes at 520 nm cannot be observed because of the ultrafast interfacial hole transfer between TiO nanoparticles and SCN. The hole and electron trapping times were estimated to be <50 and 260 fs, respectively, by the analysis of rise and decay dynamics of transient absorption spectra. The rate of the hole transfer from nanosized TiO colloid to SCN is comparable to that of the hole trapping and the time of formation of a weakly coupled (SCN···SCN) is estimated to be ∽2.3 ps with 0.3 M KSCN. A further structural change to form a stable (SCN) is observed in a timescale of 100∽150 ps, which is almost independent of the concentration of SCN. E},

   abstract = {A family of highly ordered mesoporous (20−300 Å) silica structures have been synthesized by the use of commercially available nonionic alkyl poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) oligomeric surfactants and poly(alkylene oxide) block copolymers in acid media. Periodic arrangements of mescoscopically ordered pores with cubic Im3̄m, cubic Pm3̄m (or others), 3-d hexagonal (P63/mmc), 2-d hexagonal (p6mm), and lamellar (Lα) symmetries have been prepared. Under acidic conditions at room temperature, the nonionic oligomeric surfactants frequently form cubic or 3-d hexagonal mesoporous silica structures, while the nonionic triblock copolymers tend to form hexagonal (p6mm) mesoporous silica structures. A cubic mesoporous silica structure (SBA-11) with Pm3̄m diffraction symmetry has been synthesized in the presence of C16H33(OCH2CH2)10OH (C16EO10) surfactant species, while a 3-d hexagonal (P63/mmc) mesoporous silica structure (SBA-12) results when C18EO10 is used. Surfactants with short EO segments tend to form lamellar mesostructured silica at room temperature. Hexagonal mesoporous silica structures with d(100) spacings of 64−77 Å can be synthesized at 100 °C by using oligomeric nonionic surfactants. Highly ordered hexagonal mesoporous silica structures (SBA-15) with unusually large d(100) spacings of 104−320 Å have been synthesized in the presence of triblock poly(ethylene oxide)−poly(propylene oxide)−poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO−PPO−PEO) copolymers. SBA-15 mesoporous structures have been prepared with BET surface areas of 690−1040 m2/g, pore sizes of 46−300 Å, silica wall thicknesses of 31−64 Å, and pore volumes as large as 2.5 cm3/g. A novel cubic (Im3̄m) cage-structured mesoporous silica structure (SBA-16) with a large cell parameter (a = 176 Å) has been synthesized using triblock copolymers with large PEO segments. The EO/PO ratio of the copolymers can be used to control the formation of the silica mesophase:  lowering this ratio of the triblock copolymer moieties promotes the formation of lamellar mesostructured silica, while higher ratios favor cubic mesostructured silica. Cubic mesoporous structures are also obtained when star diblock copolymers are used as structure-directing agents. The calcined ordered mesoporous silicas reported in this paper are thermally stable in boiling water for at least 48 h. The assembly of the inorganic and organic periodic composite materials appears to take place by a hydrogen bonding (S0 H+)(X-I+) pathway. The assembly rate r increases with increasing concentration of [H+] and [Cl-], according to the kinetic expression r = k[H+]0.31[Cl-]0.31.},
